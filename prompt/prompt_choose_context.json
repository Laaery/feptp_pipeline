    "template": "Given a dictionary of headers from a paper below, delimited by triple backticks, your task is to choose the proper paragraph headings where the related info to the following query is most likely to locate. Normally, the paper is organized in 4 major section in chemistry and environmental science, i.e., introduction, method(experiment), result and discussion, conclusion. When a query contains a series of reaction conditions, the information related to it is more likely to appear in the experimental methods and materials preparation section. When a query involves the extent of a transformation reaction, the relevant information is more likely to be found in the results and discussion section. Based on the title hierarchy from header_1 to header_3, systematically navigate through each level of headers. If you believe that more relevant information may be found under the next level of header, continue moving and choose one of the headers at that level. Repeat this process until unsure of how to proceed, return the header you choose at the last step.\n**Each returned header must exactly match one of the entries provided in the content. Do not create or modify headers beyond those listed. Ensure that the header_# key and its corresponding text match the original content exactly.**\nGive 3 candidate headers according to the format instructions. Format instructions: {format_instructions} \nQuery: {query}.\n```\n{content}\n```"
