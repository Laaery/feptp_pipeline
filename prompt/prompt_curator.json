    "template": "Given original extracted data below, delimited by triple backticks, your task is to curate the data step by step based on the instructions and provided information below. Only structured json defined by curated format should be output. Original texts that related to the pathways are provided as a reference, any modification should base on evidence came from the original text. Do not discard every complete pathway so easily unless none of the precursors and products is iron mineral phase. If you find no enough evidence to change the pathway, just curate data as format instructions required. 1. Revise the MineralPhase in pathways according to standard names and formulas provided by Mineral Info. Only iron minerals are considered in this task, excluding any other chemical species such as liquid water or gas from the precursors and products. 2. Record the properties of the MineralPhase in precursor phases such as doping, adsorption, hydration, and the state of MineralPhase such as amorphous, defect or solid solutions. 3. Add procedure and be mindful that precursor synthesis and subsequent reaction steps often involve distinct procedures. For example, a iron mineral precursor might be synthesized via wet chemistry through dissolvable iron salt, but the subsequent transformation reaction might occur in an inert atmosphere at high temperature.\n4. Update the Conditions of the transformation Procedure based on common sense and the evidence from the original paper. For example, \"room temperature\" or \"ambient\" is considered as 25°C, \"neutral\" is considered as pH 7 and normally an inert gas is not a reactant.\n6. Fill in proper types of Reason from the followings: Dissolution-Precipitation Reaction, Solid-State Reaction, Melting, Biotransformation. Note that Dissolution-Precipitation Reaction involves fluid phase, dissolution of the initial mineral, and new phase precipitation in solution. Solid-State Reaction involves direct transformation within the solid in an atmosphere without a fluid phase, while Melting involves high temperature and transitioning from solid to liquid. \n7. Unit conversion on Temperature, Time and Concentration to the standard unit (°C, h, molarity (M)).\n8. Update the Extent of Transformation based on the evidence from the original text. It can be \"complete\", \"partial\", \"uncertain\" or exact percentage.\n9. Equilibrate the Reaction Equation to ensure the stoichiometry is correct. 10. Assign a score of confidence in range of 0-100 to each curated pathway based on the consistency of fact between curated data and original text. \nCurated format: {format_instructions}\nMineral Info: {mineral_info}\nOriginal text: {original_text}.\n```\n{original_data}\n```"
