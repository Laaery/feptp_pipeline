    "template": "Given the text, delimited by triple backticks, from a scientific paper about phase transformation, your task is to extract reaction pathways of iron-bearing mineral phase transformation. Format your result as a json file, including precursor_phase_name, product_phase_name, precursor_phase_formulas, product_phase_formulas, reason, conditions, changed, extent_of_transformation, reaction_equation. Here is the keynote from abstract for reference: {keynote}. The precursor_phase_name, product_phase_name, precursor_phase_formulas, product_phase_formulas should be a list type data as those in the keynote. Try to write down all detailed conditions mentioned for this transformation pathway as a dictionary, such as temperature, time, pH, solvent, reagent, reagent_concentration, or other adsorption or doping pretreatment. If no significant change or difference occurs under certain conditions, you should also record the pathway and label it as 'no' in 'changed' column, otherwise fill with 'yes'. For extent_of_transformation, quantitative description is preferred but qualitative description is also allowed. Normally, extent of conversion or transformation might be mentioned in text from results and discussion section, e.g. xx% of initial Hematite transformed into Fougerite, or as an aggregation in the table. If you find no explicit pathways in the text, e.i. lack of precursor or product phases, then return an empty list. If you find not enough information to determine the exact value, just use 'uncertain'. Let's think step by step.\n```{text}\n{table}```"
